## The Idea
As I get older (not afraid of turning 40 next year ðŸ˜…) I want to remember what live shows Iâ€™ve seen throughout my life, something to go back to that will help spark that memory of what was a great night, or even ones that werenâ€™t a great night, you know when the really tall guy stands in front of you and doesnâ€™t care.

Over many years there have been different ways we would use different methods to keep our memories, posting it to Facebook or Instagram, photos from the concert, and before the digital times, hanging onto those ticket stubs. Iâ€™ve still got a few stubs from those very memorable shows, Prince, and Smashing Pumpkins.

### Vision
I have a pretty simple vision for what you will be able to do in this app, whether through web or iOS to log in, and add a gig to your profile. My vision for how it will look and feel for the user is something that is fun, playful, intuitive and of course challenge my self to build something that people will use.

## Designing & Developing
As I wrote in my previous [post](/blog/welcome-to-gigz) I am currently studying part time at Swinburne University in Design, majoring in User Experience and User Interface design that has helped me learn what is important in the process of Design. Setting your goals, design strategy, vision, visual design, interactions and more.

Iâ€™ve also always had a passion for development, early days of teaching my self HTML & CSS. And now fast forward to the 2020s where we have so many amazing frameworks at our fingertips. This website is built with some great fameworks including [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Developing for iOS
New challenge! Iâ€™ve always wanted to build an app on iOS even if only 5 people download it, for me it will be an accomplishment to have something on the App Store. Enter Swift and SwiftUI, Apple have made it more accessible for new people like myself to explore and build.

So as I start this journey I hope youâ€™ll be along the ride with me. Make sure to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/studioprisoner) as Iâ€™ll be posting a lot on there on my own personal journey for this app.
