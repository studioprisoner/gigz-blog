## Hi, I’m Josh!
I’m a designer and developer and the founder of Gigz. I’m currently in my 3rd year in Design at Swinburne University, here in Melbourne, Australia. Gigz is an idea I’ve had for a few months now and something I thought would be fun to dive into as I continue my studies.

This blog will be a place where I can take you all through the process of what I’m doing to build this product. As Paul Stamiotou says [“writing is such an extremely important part of the design process.”](https://twitter.com/stammy/status/1364261677898870785?s=21&t=DB4Gch4HrKdX-aF64qzOTQ) This space will encourage me to share openly why a decision was made and the process I took to get to that point. 

Over the course of this project I’ll be sharing user-flows, wireframes, prototypes, UI interaction videos to show early insights into how the product is looking and to collect any feedback from you, potential users.

### Minimum Viable Product
So what is our MVP for release? So at the core of it all, Gigz is a product that is there to help you remember the great live music you have seen in your life. As I become older, sometimes I forget if I saw that show back in 2004 of Broken Social Scene at The Corner Hotel here in Melbourne.

My target MVP will be adding a gig/concert to your profile with who the artist was, the venue and the date. And from there I will build out more features to help you put more details for those memorable moments, whether it’s a note, a photo of a video, who you went with and more.
